# Yet Another Rogue Like
## Description
Yet Another Rogue Like is a simple third person shooter where you progress through randomly ordered levels to get to golden discs. 
In this project we attempted to create the core gameplay of most indie roguelikes. 
There are 11 (possible) levels to play through and after getting to the end of a level, the game will pick a random level to send you to. This means you can play through repeated levels.
